You, like most people, can’t sell yourself, and it will the greatest mistake of your life not to learn.

When you think of sales, you think of cold-calling, telemarketers, sales charts, business suits, and crazy guys on TV shouting about stocks.

Yet, selling is none of that.  That’s the popular image of sales that the media feeds to you.

Rather, selling is really about giving value.  At its core, value is about giving before expecting to receive anything in return.  When you provide value, you will be in constant demand.

How do you provide value?  I’m going to tell you how.  First, professionally (make lots of money), then personally (make lots of friends).
